You helped the Imperium out quite a bit.
Yet, you ultimately decided to side with the necromancer.
That was an interesting choice on your part.
But, like many others you made, it was wrong.
No gold to aid you, this whole "putting an end to the Imperium" plan fell flat.
You should've paid more attention to the intro cutscene.
Fighting the necromancer at that point in time would have actually been much easier.
You drank the potion, and so he wouldn't have had any of his minions to help him.
But it's too late now, and you become a late man the second the rebellion failed.
Looks like your little adventure went full circle.
