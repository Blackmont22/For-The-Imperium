You had all the money in the world, and came so close to living free again.
But it seems like your greed got the best of you.
With promises of unparalleled power, the necromancer got you to join his cause.
Even after dying to his minions, you accepted.
You even helped the Imperium so, so much.
The guards and wizard and dwarf thanked you for that.
But the leaders of the Imperium, however, were furious.
They gave you an order, and you didn't comply.
So, they ended you and your little rebellion right there.
Looks like your journey ended where it started.
