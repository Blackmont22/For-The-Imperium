You join the necromancer in his quest for greatness.
But seeing as you died to his forces numerous times, and the Imperium had to bring you back...
He does most of the heavy lifting.
As powerful as he is, he cannot stop millions of soldiers headed his way, let alone the rulers of the Imperium.
And without any gold to expand your arsenal or use as components for his spells, he falls quicker than most.
After having acquired the potion in the clearing past the forest, all you had to do was drink it.
It would've then been much easier to put a stop to the necromancer and call it a day.
Maybe then you would have lived.
But regardless, you still helped out some bored members of the Imperium on their own quests.
They didn't even budge to do the things they were more than capable of doing.
Yet, you stepped in, and made their lives a little bit easier.
Even if your name isn't remembered, those deeds will be, for just a little while longer.
