Even though you perished several times at the hands of the necromancer's forces,
Even though you fought the necromancer with zero gold to your name at the end,
You persevered, a loyal subject of the Imperium.
Recognizing this, they bestowed upon you a title, and a higher rank.
They gave their utmost thanks.
And then, they said they had no use for you any longer.
With but a wave of their hand, the leaders of the Imperium returned you to the ground again.
With your name etched into the history books, your memory shall endure for far longer than your corporeal form.
All hail the Imperium.
