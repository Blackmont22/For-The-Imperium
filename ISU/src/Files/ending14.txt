You helped the Imperium a tiny bit, but it was nothing revolutionary.
Speaking of, that revolution you tried to start with the necromancer didn't turn out too well.
The instant the Imperium got word of it, they shut it down at the source.
And they celebrated when you and the necromancer were no more.
All your gold couldn't save you for what it was worth, and all the guidance in the world didn't help you.
Consider this a learning experience for next time...
If there even is one.
But one can dream...it just doesn't guarantee that they'll wake up to do anything about it.
