Not only did you not die once while confronting the necromancer and his forces,
But you also managed to do it all while ending up with no gold to your name.
That's an extremely impressive feat to accomplish.
In recognition of this, the Imperium promotes you 2 ranks higher within the faction after you finish the quest.
They also give you an official title or two.
However, they also know that they don't need you around any longer.
Hence, they force you to return to the dust from whence you came.
To be fair, it is a long break after this tedious quest of theirs. 
They could even bring you back later if they felt like it.
Either way, who knows?
All hail the Imperium.
