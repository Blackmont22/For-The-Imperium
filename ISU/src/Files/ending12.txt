You had a modest amount of gold.
But did it go to your head?
Not once did you help the Imperium out.
The guards, wizard, and dwarf all went unaided because of your ignorance.
You had all of the tools necessary to defeat the necromancer within reach.
Yet, you still didn't do it.
Such acts of treason weren't taken kindly by the Imperium.
The second they heard that you were planning a rebellion, they stepped in.
They ended it and you right where you stood.
Maybe a while ago you could get away with dying to the necromancer's forces and resurrecting.
But the Imperium wasn't going to bring back a traitor.
