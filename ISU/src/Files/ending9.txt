Was it the newfound wealth?
Or was it apathy?
Either way, you didn't assist the Imperium at all.
Were you dead set on joining the necromancer from the moment the Imperium revived you?
Regardless, it makes no difference now.
You did die a few times to the necromancer's forces, but the Imperium brought you back.
So, when you and the necromancer organized your rebellion against this grand force, you maybe miscalculated.
That was the end of your story, and no amount of miracles were going to breathe new life into you.
The Imperium wouldn't revive a traitor.
