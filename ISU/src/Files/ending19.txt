Throughout the town of Winterveil, the Forest, the Grasslands, and even the necromancer's dungeon, you didn't die once.
How easy would it have been, then, to keep up that streak when fighting the necromancer?
You most likely were powerful enough, and had plenty of gold and boosts and damage buffs to do it.
Maybe you just didn't feel like it though.
And now, you're paying for that mistake, as the necromancer's already been killed.
No, the Imperium isn't killing you, as it recognizes how strong you would have to be to not die even once.
Instead, it's forcing you to live out the rest of your days in the necromancer's dungeon, surrounded by gold that you can't use and necrotic potions that you can't comprehend.
They wish you the best of luck.
But regardless of how much luck you have, everything inevitably comes to an end anyways.
