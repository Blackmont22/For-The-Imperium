You committed the biggest sin of all by not killing the necromancer.
You, in fact, were the most capable of any being, so they say, to do so. 
And yet you made the leaders of the Imperium take time out of their day to manage the situation.
Not only did you NOT HELP the Imperium, but you also hoarded all of your gold for yourself.
How easy would it have been to just buy so many powerups that defeating the necromancer would become trivial?
How easy would it have been to just say no to joining him, especially after you died to his forces?
But you had to lead a rebellion nonetheless, and were utterly crushed like the rest of them.
Now, hopefully you can enjoy the great rest bestowed upon you by the Imperium.
