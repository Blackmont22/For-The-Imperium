During the quest, you managed to assist the Imperium to the greatest extent that you could.
You also never died to the necromancer's forces, showcasing resilience all the way through.
Not only that, but you found and consumed the potion that made fighting the necromancer so much easier.
Those feats are commendable, and for that, the Imperium applauds you.
They promote you to 3 ranks higher within the organization, and bestow a variety of formal titles upon you.
Also, even though they have no use for you anymore, they restore your age to a stout 20 years.
This gives you far more time to do what you want to do.
It also lets you live far happier than the old life you had as the most skilled soldier in the Imperium at the time.
Through your actions, the Imperium maintains its image as a beacon of hope in an otherwise dark world.
Truly, ALL HAIL THE IMPERIUM.
