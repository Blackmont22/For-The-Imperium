Your sheer incompetence was enough for the Imperium to kill you and the necromancer on the spot.
You simply died too many times to the necromancer's forces.
Regardless of how much gold you had, or how many people you helped, it didn't matter.
Time was of the essence, and you took too long.
It's a shame, really, as the Imperium would have bestowed a title upon you if you had killed the necromancer...
Like you were originally instructed to.
But maybe following instructions just wasn't your thing.
On the plus-side, you can enjoy a long break now, for your efforts.
