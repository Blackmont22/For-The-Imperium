Despite your great difficulty in overcoming the necromancer's forces,
Despite your noticeable lack of gold,
You managed to do it.
You killed the necromancer, and completed the quest.
Unfortunately, that's the only thing they brought you back for.
Knowing this, the leaders of the Nightfall Imperium dismissed you.
In an instant, you materialized back to where you started the quest, and suddenly weren't aware of many things any longer.
You just wanted to take a well-deserved rest after your efforts.
And that wish was granted.
All hail the Imperium.
