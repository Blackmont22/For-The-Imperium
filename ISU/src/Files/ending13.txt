You assisted the Imperium greatly, and had obscene amounts of gold.
Everything you needed to take down the necromancer, right there.
However, it seems you were more interested in starting a rebellion against the Imperium.
That was the wrong choice.
Maybe their ideals weren't the greatest, but the Imperium was a force too large to be reckoned with.
So all your gold couldn't save you as you were struck down alongside the necromancer.
The only difference is that he can resurrect and keep coming back, while you...can't.
You probably should have listened to the Imperium on this one.
