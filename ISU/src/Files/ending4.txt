You were so close.
And yet, you should've listened to the Imperium. 
You obtained and even consumed the potion that would've made fighting the necromancer effortless.
But along the way, you joined him. 
With no gold, and having helped members of the Imperium, he was quite skeptical.
So naturally, he did much of the work in spearheading the rebellion. 
But you both failed. 
Seeing how much you did for them, the guards and dwarf and wizard all testified on your behalf.
But the Imperium found you guilty anyways.
Rather than kill you, they forced you to live out the rest of your days under their watchful eye.
Who knew what crime you would commit next, after all?
They just wanted to be safe.
