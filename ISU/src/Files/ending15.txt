You took all your gold, and didn't even bother searching for the item that would help you fight against the necromancer.
Nor did you help the Imperium, it seems.
The guards went without reprieve.
The wizard, dwarf, and cleric all hit brick walls in their own quests without assistance.
And the merchants in Winterveil had to endure the freezing cold, for nothing.
How nice of you to make them suffer through that.
Your tiny rebellion with the necromancer never amounted to anything, because the Imperium willed it so.
And your existence did the same, because the Imperium willed it so.
For the Imperium, this was just another day.
But for you, it was your last.
