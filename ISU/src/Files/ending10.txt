You helped the Imperium so much on your journey.
The wizard got his powerup.
The dwarf saw that you were strong enough.
The guards were at least thankful they didn't have to do their job for once.
So why did you mess it up? 
You even almost had the key to defeating the necromancer right in your hands, and mountains of gold on top of that.
Oh well.
The Imperium dealt with the necromancer swiftly, and eradicated your presence even swifter.
At least you lived on in the memories of those you assisted.
