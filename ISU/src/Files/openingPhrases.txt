On the distant planet of Solitus existed two perpetually-warring states.
One, known as Tenaebris, was ruled over with generosity and sincerity by the Nightfall Imperium.
The other, traitorous Feigrstad, lay almost in ruins, weakened by the Imperium's relentless onslaught.
Soon enough, a sizable Feigrstadian resistance force managed to convince the populace of the Imperium's inferiority.
Rebellions, uprisings, and revolutions were commonplace, but they all were quelled in time.
Now, one individual in particular seeks to threaten the stability granted by the Imperium.
He goes by the name of Frazun Lonefall, a high-level necromancer who has left naught but devastation in his wake.
And he must be stopped.
