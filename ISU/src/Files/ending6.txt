Sure, you drank the potion that would've made fighting the necromancer a lot easier.
Sure, you somehow ended up with no gold to your name. 
But why didn't you at least help the Imperium out a little bit?
Maybe then, you would have lived to see another day.
Regardless, hindsight is 20/20.
You'll still be known as the soldier who fought alongside the Imperium in their old battles.
Known as the paladin who fell from grace the second he failed to persevere through his quest.
How pitiful, giving up at the last moment.
But at least your name will be known, and you won't die a second death.
