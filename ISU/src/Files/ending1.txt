Having turned your back on the Imperium and joined forces with the necromancer, you stand empowered.
For some reason, you helped members of the Imperium on their own quests for greatness.
But honestly, the dwarf, the wizard, and the guards all couldn't care less. 
They knew you were just doing it to acquire power, and as were they too.
Somewhere, you changed your mind, and it was a good choice knowing that fighting the necromancer would've been much harder.
So now, you attempt to overthrow the massive empire that had lied to you for so long.
And, like those who came before you, you were doomed to fail from the beginning.
No matter how much you disliked the empire, millions of soldiers were at their disposal.
They could spend all day waiting you out.
It's true, you fight valiantly, braver than most.
But sooner or later, you return to the dust from whence you came.
Not a penny to your name.
