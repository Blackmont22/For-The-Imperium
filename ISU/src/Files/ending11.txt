Maybe you helped the Imperium out a tiny bit.
But you still took all the gold for yourself. 
You should've spent it on potions and boosts to defeat the necromancer with.
And then you maybe would've stood a chance.
But your weak rebellion made it no further than the planning stages.
Noticing your insubordination, the Imperium delivered retribution.
And so, the question that people ask to this day is:
Who even was Grondheim Stormborn?
No one knows, not even those who were present at Winterveil and the Grasslands refuge.
At least it wasn't any worse than that.
