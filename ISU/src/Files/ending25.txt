The Imperium couldn't help but congratulate you for what you did.
Even if you had a bit of a hard time, and died again and again, it was still noteworthy.
You single-handedly put an end to the most prominent rebellion against the Imperium in decades.
In doing so, you gained a lot of gold as well.
Without anything else to do, you sort of...outlived your purpose.
The Imperium made it clear to you that that was the case.
So, whether you liked it or not, you were reverted back to a nonliving state.
Your name, however, lives on in the history books.
Your deeds shall be spoken about for eons.
And that's what truly matters.
All hail the Imperium.
