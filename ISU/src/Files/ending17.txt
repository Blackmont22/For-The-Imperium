You had so many tools at your disposal.
The merchants stood out in the cold for you to defeat the necromancer.
The guards took up their posts and didn't sleep to make sure you were safe in Winterveil
But they only got some return on their investment, so to speak.
With all your gold, you came so close to defeating the necromancer once and for all.
But at the last minute for some reason, you changed your mind.
You joined him, and, like any traitor of the Imperium,
Were dealt with accordingly.
Better luck next time, if there even is one.
