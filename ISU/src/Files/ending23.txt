Even though you perished several times at the hands of the necromancer's forces,
You managed to amass quite a substantial amount of wealth to your name.
You persevered, a loyal subject of the Imperium.
For your efforts, you gained a promotion within the Imperium, and an official title, "Saviour of the Night". 
They gave their utmost thanks.
And then, they unfortunately said that your time had ran out.
With but a mere thought, the leaders of the Imperium returned you back to the Snow-Capped Cemetery.
But do not fret.
With your name etched into the history books, your memory shall endure for far longer than your corporeal form ever did.
All hail the Imperium.
