You were a bit wealthier than you started out.
And somewhere along the way, you thought it'd be good to rebel against the group that brought you back.
This was even after you had helped the members of the Imperium a bit, be it the guards, the dwarf, or the wizard.
With a bit more exploration and maybe a fight against the necromancer, you could've made it out alive.
Alas, this wasn't the case.
The Imperium struck you and the necromancer down the second you both even thought of conducting a joint rebellion against them.
You both should have heeded the warnings they gave.
But you can't go back now, only forward.
However, the future for you holds nothing. 
You might have got too used to the Imperium resurrecting you after every little slip-up.
