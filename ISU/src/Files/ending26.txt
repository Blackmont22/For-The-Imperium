You may have struggled a bit with taking down the necromancer.
That's fine; what really matters is that you amassed a lot of gold on the way there.
This money, taken by the Imperium, will go towards the improvement of living standards and quality-of-life in Imperium-owned land.
If not anything else, that's something to be really proud of.
Sadly, the Imperium said that your time was at an end.
They had no reason for you to be hanging around anymore.
And so, with a mere thought, they sent you back to your prior state before being given this grand quest to complete.
With no worries in hand, at least your name will be remembered, and your deeds will live on alongside other legendary figures in the Imperium.
All hail the Imperium.
