You made quite a bit of money on your journey.
Not only that, but you assisted the Imperium, too.
They're grateful for that.
And so, when you rose up alongside the necromancer to try and topple their empire, they weren't too mean.
They let you keep all your wealth, and even buried it with you too.
Rather than being remembered as the vile traitor who went against their reign, they were a bit kinder.
No one even knows who Grondheim Stormborn was, if he even existed in the first place.
The dwarf, the guards, and the wizard have some faint recollection of someone helping them, at least.
But a paladin doesn't sound right, and there certainly wasn't a necromancer involved...
Even though the Imperium did resurrect you the previous times you died to the necromancer's minions, it was different now.
They just couldn't be bothered.
