Although you met your demise a few times at the hands of the necromancer's minions,
You got the job done, with a lot of gold to spare.
You persevered, a loyal subject of the Imperium to the end.
With the necromancer out of the way, it was now business as usual.
That being, the Imperium returned all formerly-dead individuals back to their former state.
This included you, unfortunately.
They told you not to give up hope, however, as there may come a time where you'll be called on again, if needed.
All hail the Imperium.
