You really didn't want to help the Imperium's forces out, did you?
The town guards in Winterveil, the dwarf, the wizard, all went unaided in their quests.
Perhaps it was for the better, but you did miss out on obtaining some gold at the end of the day.
But gold probably is worthless to you anyway, as you got here without any of it.
Here, the necromancer's dungeon, where you up and left the Imperium to aid in the necromancer's rebellion.
It didn't go anywhere, unfortunately, and you both met your end at the hands of some annoyed Imperium soldiers.
The Imperium does bring stability and prosperity to the nation after all, its methods are maybe just a little too...
Authoritarian.
To be fair, to join the necromancer after you died to his forces numerous times truly was unexpected.
But it's this element of choice that makes you free.
Even now, when all has faded away.
